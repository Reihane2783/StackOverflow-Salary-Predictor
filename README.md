# StackOverflow-Salary-Predictor
Data preprocessing and regression project using Stack Overflow Survey data (2021-2024). Includes detailed EDA with correlation matrices and relationship plots (Experience/Education vs. Salary) to identify key features and train an optimized regression model.
This project focuses on the foundational steps of a Machine Learning workflow: Data Preprocessing and Regression Analysis, using real-world data from the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Surveys (2021-2024).

Key Objectives:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing multi-year survey datasets for predictive modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): * Visualizing relationships between key variables such as Salary vs. Years of Experience and Salary vs. Education level.
Analyzing feature dependencies using a Correlation Matrix to identify informative or redundant variables.
Regression Modeling: Implementing and training the most suitable regression model to predict developer salaries based on the processed features.

Technologies Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook) 
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-Learn for regression modeling.
